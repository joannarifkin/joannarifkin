## About me

I'm a geneticist and bioinformatician. In my extensive experience with non-model systems, I've had a lot of practice adapting bioinformatic tools to solve problems in creative ways. 

Below, you can learn more about the [skills](#skills) this has given me, see the [publications](#publications) that have resulted, find a [CV](#cv) or [contact info](#contact-info), scroll through some of my [repositories](#repositories), and even see what I do for [fun](#fun).

Thanks for stopping by!

### Skills

As a bioinformatician, I'm comfortable using a variety of approaches and languages. Conceptually, I apply statistical genetics and data science approaches to solve problems. I use R, Python, and a variety of specialized genetics software including the GATK, samtools, and many others. I've worked in several Linux-based high-performance computing (HPC) environments with different queueing systems and structures. I have experience with variant-calling and large-scale genomic analyses with multiple sequencing methods and approaches, including RNAseq, reduced-representation, and long reads.

As a geneticist, I use the tools of quantitative and population genetics to relate phenotypes and genotypes and make inferences about how evolution shapes genomic features. I have applied these tools to several non-model plant systems, and enjoy translating my skills to new contacts.

Outside of technical skills, I'm committed to scientific communication. When working as a publicly funded scientist, I took my responsibility to the general public seriously and worked hard to hone my oral and written communication skills. These efforts have paid off in the variety of grants I've received (see my [CV](#cv) for details). I'm comfortable managing complex self-directed projects, but I also enjoy working in teams.

### Fun

What's life without a little fun?

When I'm not at work, you can find me rock climbing at [Basecamp in Toronto](https://basecampclimbing.ca/), volunteering with [Not Far from the Tree](https://notfarfromthetree.org/), growing fruits and vegetables in my garden, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and chasing my unruly cats off the table. I live in Toronto, and love it!
